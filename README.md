   javac Main.java Aluno.java
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```
   java Main
   ```

## Project Files
- `Aluno.java` — Defines the `Aluno` class with attributes, methods to calculate the average, check approval, and display information.
- `Main.java` — Creates an instance of `Aluno`, calculates the average, verifies approval, and shows the data.
